# How to try it locally

With emulators (if you already use them):
```
cd functions
npm run serve
```

Send a create request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/us-central1/api/v1/users `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d "{\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"name\":\"Test User\"}"
```

List users:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/us-central1/api/v1/users
```
You should now see the document appear in the Emulator UI (Firestore / users collection).

Notes
CreateUserDto and UpdateUserDto validation still runs before persisting.
Firestore doc IDs are generated by Firestore (no longer using crypto.randomUUID).
Update merges fields you pass; unspecified fields remain.
Delete returns 204 on success, 404 if the document doesn’t exist.
Let me know if you’d like:

Adding indexes / security rules examples
Converting posts service similarly
Adding unit tests or integration tests against the emulator
Just tell me what you want next.
